# Dapr Workshop - C#

The Dapr workshop is a workshop that teaches you how to apply Dapr to a microservices application. This repository contains the source-code that forms the starting point of the C# (.NET) version of the workshop. With each workshop assignment you will expand the application with a Dapr building block.

See the Dapr workshop repository for more information and instructions on how to get started.
